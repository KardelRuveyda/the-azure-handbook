# CHAPTER 13: The Future — Decentralized Identity (DID)

In the traditional model, companies own your account. **Decentralized Identity** shifts control back to the **User**.

## 1. What is Digital Identity?
Your identity is not just what you say about yourself; it is the sum of what **Trusted Others** (Government, Employer, University) attest about you.

## 2. The Triangle of Trust
Decentralized Identity uses three main players:
1.  **The Issuer:** A trusted entity (e.g., your employer) that creates a **Verifiable Credential (VC)**.
2.  **The Holder (User):** You receive the VC and store it in your **Digital Wallet** (e.g., Microsoft Authenticator).
3.  **The Verifier:** An entity (e.g., a bank) that needs to check your information.

## 3. Selective Disclosure & Privacy
This is the most critical feature. A user can share *only* what is necessary.
* **The Scenario:** You need to prove you are over 21. 
* **The Solution:** Your wallet shares a digital "claim" that says "True." You **do not** have to share your birthday, address, or full name.
* **Consent:** The user has complete control over what is shared. The system is rooted in a shared trust system, such as a **Blockchain**, to ensure authenticity without a central authority.
